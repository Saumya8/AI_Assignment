Q1: Build an Expert System that can recommend conferences and journals by asking the user 
questions about their preferences regarding their topic of research, keywords, abstract, 
submission deadlines, conference ranking, journal impact factor and so on. The Expert 
System is to make its recommendations based on the preferences. If you can provide expert 
advice for the journals/conferences in which the user has previously published would be an 
added advantage. 
Note: The build to has to be implemented in Python. You can consider any of the datasets 
available in the Internet. Please output the rules as well which led to conclusion.
Impact Factor: - No. of Citations (current year)/No. Of Articles Published (last 2 years). 
Optionally, you can create a filter that recommends journals based on the submission 
deadline and time taken for first decision by the Journal.

Q2: BITS Hyderabad campus has started a new initiative to develop safety regulations for 
monitoring the speed of the vehicles inside the campus. For such scenario, they have put restrictions 
on speeding of vehiclesto avoid the risk of making accidents and hence, resulting in casualties. You are 
assigned the job of constructing a Bayesian network to help the vehicle drivers decide whether or not 
to speed. Some personnel have been assigned the duty to check the over speeding on the roads. Each 
of the attributes listed below is Boolean. The attribute See-Personnel indicates whether or not the
driver detects the personnel; Slow-traffic indicates whether or not the vehicle is driven at below the 
speed limit; Speed indicates whether or not the driver speeds; Fine Chit indicates whether or not the
driver gets a fine (Rs 500) for over-speeding or not; On-Time indicates whether or not the driver arrives
on time to pick the concerned person or not etc. You are free to add few more attributes if you feel
these will improve the outcome of uncertainty reasoning. [15 Marks]
You are given the following information:
P(Personnel=T) = 0.8, P(See-Personnel = T|Personnel =T) = 0.7, P(See-Personnel = T|Personnel =F) = 
0.1
P(Slow-traffic = T|Personnel =T) = 0.6, P(Slow-traffic = T|Personnel =F) = 0.5, 
P(Fine Chit = T|Personnel,Speed) = {0.4, if Personnel and Speed are T and 
 0.2, otherwise}
P(On-Time= T|Fine Chit,Speed,Slow Traffic) = { 0.1, if Fine Chit is T;
 0.7, if Fine Chit is F and Speed is T; 
 0.5, if Fine Chit is F, Speed is F, Slow-Traffic is F; 
 0.3, if Ticket is F, Speed is F and Slow-traffic is T}
Your job is to design or build a Bayesian Network for modelling the above situation. Try finding out 
the Joint probability distributions for the following using the Bayes Net:
(a) In case the traffic isslow, willseeing the Personnel affect the probability of the vehicle driver
getting a Fine Chit?
(b) Verify the question 2(a) for the vehicle being On-Time. (Assume value of Slow-Traffic is 
unknown). You need to model the above Bayesian network and simulate it using SamIam 
tool/ Genie tool. 
SamIam is a software tool for the creation and consultation of Bayesian networks. The SamIam 
software package can be downloaded from: http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/
An alternative package is Genie, a Windows-based system, which, however, also runs on Linux using 
wine; it contains much more functionality than SamIam. However, as a consequence of this, Genie it 
is less easy to use than SamIam. Genie can be downloaded from: https://www.bayesfusion.com/
