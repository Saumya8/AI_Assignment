Diarrhea — loose, watery and possibly more-frequent bowel movements — is a common problem.

Luckily, diarrhea is usually short-lived, lasting no more than a few days. 
But, when diarrhea lasts for weeks, it usually indicates that's there's another problem. 
If you have diarrhea for weeks or longer, you may have a condition such as irritable bowel disorder, or a more serious disorder, such as a persistent infection or inflammatory bowel disease.
